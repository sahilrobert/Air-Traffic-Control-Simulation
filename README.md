# 🛫 Air Traffic Control Simulation (DSA Project)

This is a **non-real-time simulation** of an Air Traffic Control (ATC) system built using the C programming language as part of a Data Structures & Algorithms project at REVA University.

The program demonstrates basic queue-based flight management for **arrivals** and **departures**, showcasing how air traffic control logic can be modeled using data structures like arrays and structs.

---

## 📌 Features

- Simulates **arrival and departure queues** for flights
- Uses **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** logic for both queues
- Clean modular design with reusable functions
- Output shows how flights are added and processed

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is a **simulation only** and does **not operate in real-time** or connect to any real-world data or systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C**
- Concepts: **Structures**, **Arrays**, **Queue logic**, **String handling**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program creates a structure for flights and manages two separate queues:
   - **Departure Queue**
   - **Arrival Queue**

2. Flights are added to each queue using dedicated functions.
3. A controller can simulate processing the next flight for takeoff or landing.
4. Outputs are printed to the terminal for each action.

## 💻 Sample Output

Flight DL123 added to departure queue. Flight UA456 added to arrival queue. Flight DL123 cleared for departure. Flight UA456 cleared to land.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Demonstrate understanding of **queue-based algorithms**
- Simulate basic ATC operations using simple data structures
- Provide a base model that can be extended for advanced simulation systems
